Hi there, stranger!

My name is **Gianguido `gsora` Sor√†**, I'm an Italian computer science student.

I don't really like to give myself a tag, instead I like to introduce myself as a *young hacker* where "hacker" means someone who likes to tinker with new stuff and learn how it works, then have fun modifying it!

I write mostly **Go** and **C**, with a sprinkle of **Python** here and there when needed to automate code generation and automate something which needs a little more *brain*.

Besides I do **Android** development too, just for fun.

I do most of my daily computing on **OpenBSD** - which I discovered recently - but there are some tasks in my daily routine which require software not available on Puffy's OS and for those, I use **Fedora**.

I used to love VIM but nowadays I prefer using both **Neovim** and **Visual Studio Code**.

Talking about non-*CS things*, I am a guitarist and wannabe-audiophile.

Right now, rig is made of an American Standard **Fender Stratocaster** and an Ibanez RG870QMZ.

My audio gear consists of:
 - Fiio F9 Pro IEMs
 - Fiio E17K, used as desktop DAC/AMP
 - Sennheiser HD 380 Pro
 - M-Audio Fast Track Pro, mostly used to capture guitar and mix

My musical tastes are various, but let's say that I listen from Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd going straight into Dream Theater, Protest The Hero, crossing Periphery, Porcupine Tree, finally touching Deadmau5, Pendulum and Knife Party.

I really enjoy mountain-biking when possible, or a good competitive game on **Counter-Strike: Global Offensive** with my friends.
