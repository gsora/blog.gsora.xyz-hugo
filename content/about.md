Hi there, stranger!

My name is **Gianguido Sor√†**, alias **peppelakappa**/**plk**/**gsora** and I'm a young italian computer science student.

I don't really like to give myself a tag when talking of software development, instead I like to introduce myself as a *young hacker* where "hacker" means someone who likes to tinker with new stuff and learn how it works, then have fun modifying it!

Even if it's not a great practice for someone who works with programming languages to declare a preferred one, my love for **Python** must be known, but lately I'm starting to have a lot of fun with **Go** too.

Beside Python and Go thanks to my CS course I had the pleasure to work with **C**, **Java** and **Objective-C**.

I use GNU/Linux as my main development workspace, on my ThinkPad X230.

I used to love VIM but nowadays I prefer using both **Neovim** and **Visual Studio Code**.

Talking about what I do and like other than *CS things*, I am a guitarist and a wannabe-audiophile.

Right now, rig is made of an American Standard **Fender Stratocaster** and an Ibanez RG870QMZ, a Fender Mustang III, a pair of **Sennheiser HD 380 Pro** and a M-Audio Fast Track Pro.

My musical tastes are various, but let's say that I listen from Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd going straight into Dream Theater, Protest The Hero, crossing Periphery, Porcupine Tree, finally touching Deadmau5, Pendulum and Knife Party.

I really enjoy mountain-biking when possible, and good competitive game on **Counter-Strike: Global Offensive** with my friends too.
